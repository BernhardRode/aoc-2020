== Hello World

This solution is written in Java.

To run the final program, you need JDK 11.
Thanks to http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330], launching is as easy as `java Solution.java` within the folder where the java file is located.

(Thanks to Michal Simons, I've adopted his approach in AoC 2019).

=== First Star

The solutions shall print out a greeting.

The greeting includes the _"Advent of Code 2020"_ part which is read from `input.txt`.
The file content is formatted into the greeting string via `System.out.printf(...)`.

This example demonstrates that Java code can be similarly short as Kotlin when it comes to reading the contents of a file and printing a message ;-)

=== Second Star

There is no second star.
