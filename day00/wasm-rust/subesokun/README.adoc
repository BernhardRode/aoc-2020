== Rust + WASM

Runs Rust directly in your browser âœ¨

> Hint: When running in Codespaces make sure that your terminal is running in a Bash session (just enter "bash" to start it)

=== Run locally

```
# in a new terminal
./build-wasm.sh     # auto rebuilds on changes

# in a new terminal
cd www
npm start           # auto rebuilds on changes

# In your browser open the localhost:8080 or in Codespaces the provided url
# -> Have a look in your console for the output
# Hint: Auto-reload of web page works only on localhost as Codespaces blocks the WebSocket connection for some reason
```
